For this lab, you should write a tiny python program, called "test.c",
that prints "resultado" to stdout and then indicates success by
exiting with a status of zero.

To test your work:
linux> python test.py (python3.6)

To run the same autograder that Autolab will use when you submit:
linux> ./driver.sh

Files:
README          This file
Makefile        Compiles test.py
driver.sh       Autolab autograder
test.py         Empty .py file that you will edit
